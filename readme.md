# Demo app: Counter
This repository was created to go along with the talk I gave about Elm.
It features a very basic typical Elm application built with the Elm Architecture 
using custom assets i.e. my own html/css.

This repository has several branches for the different milestones in the 
development of this application. This means you can browse through the branches
at your own pace and see what incremental steps were taken to move from 1 
milestone to the next.

## Building and running the code
Follow these steps to build the project on your system:

1. Install Elm by following the instructions on 
https://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html
2. Open up a terminal and run `elm-make Main.elm --output elm.js` to build 
the project on the master and assets branches. On all other branches, run 
`elm-make Main.elm`.
3. Open the index.html file in this directory in your web browser of choice.
