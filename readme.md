# Demo app: Counter
This repository was created to go along with the talk I gave about Elm.
It features a very basic typical Elm application built with the Elm Architecture 
using custom assets i.e. my own html/css.

This repository has several branches for the different milestones in the 
development of this application. This means you can browse through the branches
at your own pace and see what incremental steps were taken to move from 1 
milestone to the next.
